🛍️ Ecommerce Website

A modern React-based ecommerce web application with product listings, discounts, wishlist, cart, and checkout flow. Built with React Router, React Toastify, and interactive components like sliders, maps, and carousels.

📖 About the Project

This project was inspired by my brother’s menswear shop. Long before I knew how to code, I thought it would be amazing to learn programming by building a digital version of our shop.

The UI/UX design, layout, and branding were completely created by me.

The products use real photos of items we sold in the shop.

All static assets were created to give the site a realistic feel.

Building this project allowed me to learn React, Vite, React Router, and interactive UI components like carousels, countdowns, and maps.

⚠️ We don’t claim the brands are original or ours — the shop worked more like a retail operation, and this project is for educational/portfolio purposes only.
